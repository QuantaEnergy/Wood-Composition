# Wood-Composition
Trees are both Solar Collectors &amp; Batteries! Don´t cut them down. Keep them &amp; Preserve our Forests! We can produce all the Solar Power we need from outer space, deserts, mountain ranges, &amp; oceans (Solar Sea). Have Robots manage forests by collecting fallen &amp; rotting wood &amp; burning it &amp; returning nutrients to soil.
