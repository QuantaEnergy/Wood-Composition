# Preserve Forest Ecosystems with Robotics
Forests provide rich Biodiversity! It is the Genetic Inheritance of Earth. Additionally: Trees are both Solar Collectors & Batteries! Don´t cut them down. Keep them &amp; Preserve our Forests! We can produce all the Solar Power we need from outer space, deserts, mountain ranges, & oceans (Solar Sea). Have Robots manage forests by collecting fallen & rotting wood & leaves, then burning it & collecting & returning nutrients to soil to re-fertilize it. Keep valuable elements like Magnesium & Copper to make Hutchison ¨Crystal Batteries¨ and other elements to create refractory materials.

# Wood-Composition
Wood is Nature´s Battery: An energy storage medium that can last as long as it´s kept dry & doesn´t rot. This is the perfect fuel for Tesla turbines! We´ll preserve the forests but collect the excess fallen wood & leaves, capture the smoke with electrostatic precipitators process the ask and return the nutrients to the soil.
