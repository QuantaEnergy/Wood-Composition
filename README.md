# Wood-Composition
Trees are both Solar Collectors & Batteries! Don´t cut them down. Keep them &amp; Preserve our Forests! We can produce all the Solar Power we need from outer space, deserts, mountain ranges, & oceans (Solar Sea). Have Robots manage forests by collecting fallen & rotting wood & leaves, then burning it & collecting & returning nutrients to soil to re-fertilize it. Keep valuable elements like Magnesium & Copper to make Hutchison ¨Crystal Batteries¨ and other elements to create refractory materials.
